Preliminary redundancy reduction was implemented with CD-HIT-EST v.4.6.
```
for i in Species; do /opt/biosoft/anaconda3_package/bin/cd-hit-est -i ${i}_total_trinity.fasta -o ${i}_cdhitest.fasta -c 0.95 -n 10 ; done
```

The longest transcripts were selected using the “get_longest_isoform_seq_per_trinity_gene.pl” implemented in Trinity.
```
for i in Species; do /opt/biosoft/anaconda3_package/bin/misc/get_longest_isoform_seq_per_trinity_gene.pl ${i}_cdhitest.fasta > ${i}_longest.fasta ; done
```
